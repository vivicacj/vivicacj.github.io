                    <div class="note"><div class="note-title">1.1.5: Defining 'Sense of Place'</div><div class="note-content">'Sense of place' is the personal connection (meanings, memories, importance) that people associate with specific locations in their neighbourhoods, shaped by their experiences.</div></div>
                    <div class="note"><div class="note-title">1.1.6: Acquiring 'Sense of Place'</div><div class="note-content">This is formed through two main ways: 1) Routine and repetition (e.g., encountering the same people and objects on a daily commute) and 2) Memorable events that occur at local landmarks or gathering places.</div></div>
                    <div class="note"><div class="note-title">1.1.7: Representing 'Sense of Place'</div><div class="note-content">Individuals and organisations use various media (photos, stories, art, maps) to express their sense of place.

                        <div class="note-content"><strong>Concept Core:</strong> Singapore is organised into numerous self-sufficient towns, each designed with a hierarchical structure to serve the needs of its residents efficiently.<br><br><strong>Key Process:</strong> Each town typically has a central hub for major commercial and transport services. This is supported by smaller neighbourhood centres and local precincts, creating a nested system that minimizes travel for daily necessities and fosters community interaction.<br><br><strong>Case Anchor:</strong> <strong>Toa Payoh</strong>, as Singapore's first satellite town planned in the 1960s, exemplifies this model. Its iconic circular town centre was designed to house a library, cinema, and department stores, while surrounding residential blocks were served by local markets and shops, creating a blueprint for subsequent HDB towns.</div>

This increases preparedness, while local community groups and school programmes can educate residents on necessary precautions, fostering a more resilient response to such events.</div>

                        <div class="note-content"><strong>Concept Core:</strong> Monsoons are seasonal winds that reverse direction between summer and winter, caused by the differential heating of large landmasses and oceans.<br><br><strong>Key Process:</strong> In summer, the land heats up faster than the sea, creating a large area of low pressure over the land. This draws in moist, high-pressure air from the ocean, leading to a wet season with heavy rainfall. In winter, the process reverses: the land cools faster, creating high pressure that pushes dry air out towards the warmer, low-pressure ocean, resulting in a dry season.<br><br><strong>Case Anchor:</strong> The <strong>Indian Summer Monsoon</strong> is a classic example. During the summer months, the intense heating of the <strong>Tibetan Plateau and the Indian subcontinent</strong> creates a massive low-pressure system. This draws in warm, moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, causing torrential rainfall that is vital for agriculture across South Asia.</div>

The jagged edges of the plates lock together due to immense friction, causing strain and stress to accumulate in the crust over decades or centuries. When the stress finally overcomes the friction, the plates slip suddenly and violently, releasing the stored energy as seismic waves, resulting in an earthquake. Volcanic activity is absent as no crust is being created or destroyed.<br><br><strong>Case Anchor:</strong> The <strong>San Andreas Fault</strong> in California is a classic example, marking the boundary between the Pacific Plate (moving northwest) and the North American Plate (moving southeast). It is responsible for significant seismic activity in the region, including the major 1906 San Francisco earthquake.</div>

They are extremely destructive as they can travel dozens of kilometres, burying everything in their path.<br><br><strong>Case Anchor:</strong> The 1985 eruption of the <strong>Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia</strong> triggered catastrophic lahars.

                        <div class="note-content"><strong>Concept Core:</strong> Adaptation strategies are actions taken to manage the unavoidable impacts of climate change, reducing harm and building resilience to future changes.<br><br><strong>Key Process:</strong> For a low-lying, coastal city like Singapore, adaptation involves a multi-pronged approach: protecting the coastline from sea-level rise, managing storm water from more intense rainfall, and mitigating the urban heat island effect. This requires significant long-term planning and investment in infrastructure.<br><br><strong>Case Anchor:</strong> The <strong>Marina Barrage</strong> is a flagship example of Singapore's multi-purpose adaptation strategy. Functionally, it is a dam across the Marina Channel that serves three key purposes: 1) <strong>Flood Control</strong> for the low-lying city centre by acting as a tidal barrier, 2) <strong>Water Supply</strong> by creating the Marina Reservoir, a freshwater source, and 3) <strong>Lifestyle Attraction</strong> by providing a venue for recreation. It simultaneously addresses multiple climate change risks.</div>
